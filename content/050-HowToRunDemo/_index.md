To run a demo navigate to the target web site, and go into "Demo Execution" mode by enabling the "Injection" and disabling the "Inspection". 

HotSpots will not be highlighted like when 'Inspection' mode is enabled, but the extension icon will provide you some guidance:

- Extension icon shows a badge with a counter that increments each time you clicked on a HotSpot, indicating that the action triggered. A Reset Session will reset this counter.
- When you mouse over a HotSpot, the extension icon will show an abbreviation of the action that would fire if you would click on the 'mouse-overed' element. This is very useful to remind you where to click next in your demo.
