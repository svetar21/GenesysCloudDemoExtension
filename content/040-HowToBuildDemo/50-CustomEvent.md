### How to send Predictive Engagement 'Custom Event'

>Note: This feature is only available if you are using PureCloudNow Org.

Custom Events are similar to Web Events, but they are not part of the Web session. They are supposed to be originating from a different system, for instance a payment gateway, a delivery sub-system,...

- Choose an element of the website
- Right-click on this element
- In the contextual menu, click on 'Create function'
- Select 'Record Custom Event'
- Decide if you want this event to be added to the previous session of the same type (New Session unchecked) or if you want this event to start a new session for the selected type (New Session checked)
- Choose the event from the dropdown - do not type your own event name, as it would result in the event not being displayed to the agent
- Fill the desired attribute name/value pairs
- 'Save', then 'Close'
